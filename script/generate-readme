### Faster

On Ubuntu runners, setup-go-faster typically takes about 4s vs 10s for setup-go. This is difficult to benchmark on MacOS
and Windows because the action runners are inconsistent from one run to another.

When using a pre-installed version of go, the times are in the 1s range for both setup-go and setup-go-faster.

The performance improvement is achieved by using simple bash scripts instead of nodejs meaning there is less overhead
to deal with.

The exception to the bash-only rule is setup-go-faster downloads and runs https://github.com/WillAbides/semver-select
to evaluate some version constraints. This takes about 700-1000ms and only affects workflows that use semver constraints.

### Install tip

Setup-go-faster will install go tip from source if you set `go-version: tip`.

### New versions available immediately

No need to wait around for another repo to merge a PR when a new version of go is released. Setup-go-faster gets
available versions directly from https://golang.org/dl. As soon as a release is available there, it\'s available to your
workflow.

### Check out the outputs

Look at those outputs. If you want to use GOPATH or GOMODCACHE as input in some other step, you can just grab it from
setup-go-faster\'s output instead of having to add another step just to set an environment variable.

### What\'s missing?

Just the `stable` input. I don\'t understand what `stable` adds for actions/setup-go. If you only want stable builds
you can set go-version accordingly. If there is good use case for `stable`, it can be added.
